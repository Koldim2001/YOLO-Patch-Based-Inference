# YOLO-Patch-Based-Inference
This library facilitates various visualizations of inference results from YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models, cropping with overlays, as well as a __patch-based inference algorithm enabling detection of small objects in images__. It works for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks using YOLO models.

## Installation
You can install the library via pip:

```bash
pip install patched_yolo_infer
```

## Notebooks

Interactive notebooks are provided to showcase the functionality of the library. These notebooks cover batch-inference procedures for detection, instance segmentation, inference custom visualization, and more. Each notebook is paired with a tutorial on YouTube, making it easy to learn and implement features.
