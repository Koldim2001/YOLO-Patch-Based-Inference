# YOLO-Patch-Based-Inference

This Python library simplifies SAHI-like inference for instance segmentation tasks, enabling the detection of small objects in images. It caters to both object detection and instance segmentation tasks, supporting a wide range of Ultralytics models. 

The library also provides a sleek customization of the visualization of the inference results for all models, both in the standard approach (direct network run) and the unique patch-based variant.

**Model Support**: The library offers support for multiple ultralytics deep learning [models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/), such as YOLOv8, YOLOv8-seg, YOLOv9, YOLOv9-seg, YOLOv10, YOLO11, YOLO11-seg, FastSAM, and RTDETR. Users can select from pre-trained options or utilize custom-trained models to best meet their task requirements.

## Usage

### 1. Patch-Based-Inference
To carry out patch-based inference of YOLO models using our library, you need to follow a sequential procedure. First, you create an instance of the `MakeCropsDetectThem` class, providing all desired parameters related to YOLO inference and the patch segmentation principle.<br/> Subsequently, you pass the obtained object of this class to `CombineDetections`, which facilitates the consolidation of all predictions from each overlapping crop, followed by intelligent suppression of duplicates. <br/>Upon completion, you receive the result, from which you can extract the desired outcome of frame processing.

The output obtained from the process includes several attributes that can be leveraged for further analysis or visualization:

1. img: This attribute contains the original image on which the inference was performed. It provides context for the detected objects.

2. confidences: This attribute holds the confidence scores associated with each detected object. These scores indicate the model's confidence level in the accuracy of its predictions.

3. boxes: These bounding boxes are represented as a list of lists, where each list contains four values: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]. These values correspond to the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of each bounding box.

4. polygons: If available, this attribute provides a list containing NumPy arrays of polygon coordinates that represent segmentation masks corresponding to the detected objects. These polygons can be utilized to accurately outline the boundaries of each object.

5. classes_ids: This attribute contains the class IDs assigned to each detected object. These IDs correspond to specific object classes defined during the model training phase.

6. classes_names: These are the human-readable names corresponding to the class IDs. They provide semantic labels for the detected objects, making the results easier to interpret.

```python
import cv2
from patched_yolo_infer import MakeCropsDetectThem, CombineDetections

# Load the image 
img_path = "test_image.jpg"
img = cv2.imread(img_path)

element_crops = MakeCropsDetectThem(
    image=img,
    model_path="yolo11m.pt",
    segment=False,
    shape_x=640,
    shape_y=640,
    overlap_x=25,
    overlap_y=25,
    conf=0.5,
    iou=0.7,
)
result = CombineDetections(element_crops, nms_threshold=0.25)  

# Final Results:
img=result.image
confidences=result.filtered_confidences
boxes=result.filtered_boxes
polygons=result.filtered_polygons
classes_ids=result.filtered_classes_id
classes_names=result.filtered_classes_names
```

## Tips for achieving the best Patch-Based-Inference results

1. **Optimal Crop Size and Overlap**: Ensuring high-quality results involves carefully selecting the size of crops (patches) and their overlap. It is advisable not to create an excessive number of crops, and to set the overlap between 15% to 40%.

2. **Visualizing Crops**: To review the crops generated, set `show_crops=True` during the initialization of the `MakeCropsDetectThem` element. This will display the number of patches and an image showing how these patches look based on your initialized parameters (`shape_x`, `shape_y`, `overlap_x`, and `overlap_y`).

3. **Crop Size Considerations**: The size of each crop must exceed the size of the largest object intended to be detected in the image. Otherwise, the object may not be detected.

4. **Enhancing Detection Within Patches**: To detect more objects within a single crop, increase the `imgsz` parameter and lower the confidence threshold (`conf`). All parameters available for configuring Ultralytics model inference are also accessible during the initialization of the `MakeCropsDetectThem` element.

5. **Handling Duplicate Suppression Issues**: If you encounter issues with duplicate suppression from overlapping patches, consider adjusting the `nms_threshold` and `sorter_bins` parameters in `CombineDetections` or modifying the overlap and size parameters of the patches themselves. (PS: often lowering `sorter_bins` to 4 or 2 can help).

6. **Handling Multi-Class Detection Issues**: If you are working on a multi-class detection or instance segmentation task, it may be beneficial to switch the mode to `class_agnostic_nms=False` in the `CombineDetections` parameters. The default mode, with `class_agnostic_nms` set to True, is particularly effective when handling a large number of closely related classes in pre-trained YOLO networks (for example, when there is often confusion between classes like `car` and `truck`). If in your scenario, an object of one class can physically be inside an object of another class, you should definitely set `class_agnostic_nms=False` for such cases.

7. **High-Quality Instance Segmentation**: For tasks requiring high-quality results in instance segmentation, detailed guidance is provided in the next section of the README.

## __How to improve the quality of the algorithm for the task of instance segmentation:__

In this approach, all operations under the hood are performed on binary masks of recognized objects. Storing these masks consumes a lot of memory, so this method requires more RAM and slightly more processing time. However, the accuracy of recognition significantly improves, which is especially noticeable in cases where there are many objects of different sizes and they are densely packed. Therefore, we recommend using this approach in production if accuracy is important and not speed, and if your computational resources allow storing hundreds of binary masks in RAM.

The difference in the approach to using the function lies in specifying the parameter ```memory_optimize=False``` in the ```MakeCropsDetectThem``` class.
In such a case, the informative values after processing will be the following:

1. img: This attribute contains the original image on which the inference was performed. It provides context for the detected objects.

2. confidences: This attribute holds the confidence scores associated with each detected object. These scores indicate the model's confidence level in the accuracy of its predictions.

3. boxes: These bounding boxes are represented as a list of lists, where each list contains four values: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]. These values correspond to the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of each bounding box.

4. masks: This attribute provides segmentation binary masks corresponding to the detected objects. These masks can be used to precisely delineate object boundaries.

5. classes_ids: This attribute contains the class IDs assigned to each detected object. These IDs correspond to specific object classes defined during the model training phase.

6. classes_names: These are the human-readable names corresponding to the class IDs. They provide semantic labels for the detected objects, making the results easier to interpret.


Here's how you can obtain them:
```python
img=result.image
confidences=result.filtered_confidences
boxes=result.filtered_boxes
masks=result.filtered_masks
classes_ids=result.filtered_classes_id
classes_names=result.filtered_classes_names
```

## __How to automatically determine optimal parameters for patches (crops):__

To efficiently process a large number of images of varying sizes and contents, manually selecting the optimal patch sizes and overlaps can be difficult.. To address this, an algorithm has been developed to automatically calculate the best parameters for patches (crops).

The  `auto_calculate_crop_values` function operates in two modes:

1. **Resolution-Based Analysis**: This mode evaluates the resolution of the source images to determine the optimal patch sizes and overlaps. It is faster but may not yield the highest quality results because it does not take into account the actual objects present in the images.

2. **Neural Network-Based Analysis**: This advanced mode employs a neural network to analyze the images. The algorithm performs a standard inference of the network on the entire image and identifies the largest detected objects. Based on the sizes of these objects, the algorithm selects patch parameters to ensure that the largest objects are fully contained within a patch, and overlapping patches ensure comprehensive coverage. In this mode, it is necessary to input the model that will be used for patch-based inference in the subsequent steps.

Possible arguments of the ```auto_calculate_crop_values``` function:
| **Argument**          | **Type**               | **Default**  | **Description**                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| image                 | np.ndarray             |              | 	The input image in BGR format.                                                                                                            |
| mode                 | str      | "network_based"   | The type of analysis to perform. Can be "resolution_based" for Resolution-Based Analysis or "network_based" for Neural Network-Based Analysis.|
| model                 | ultralytics model      | YOLO("yolo11m.pt")   | Pre-initialized model object for "network_based" mode. If not provided, the default YOLO11m model will be used.|
| classes_list          | list                   | None          | A list of class indices to consider for object detection in "network_based" mode. If None, all classes will be considered. |
| conf                  | float                  | 0.25          | The confidence threshold for detection in "network_based" mode. |

Example of using:
```python
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO
from patched_yolo_infer import auto_calculate_crop_values

# Load the image
img_path = "test_image.jpg"
img = cv2.imread(img_path)

# Calculate the optimal crop size and overlap for an image
shape_x, shape_y, overlap_x, overlap_y = auto_calculate_crop_values(
    image=img, mode="network_based", model=YOLO("yolo11m.pt")
)
```

## __Implementing Patching at Different Resolutions__

There is an opportunity to produce cropping into patches at different resolutions. This way, small objects can be detected when cropping into smaller patches, and large objects can be detected when cropping into larger patches. As a result, the algorithm will be able to detect a wider range of object sizes in the frame. To achieve this, the image needs to be processed multiple times through MakeCropsDetectThem with different patch parameters, and then pass the list of element_crops to the CombineDetections process.

An example of using this approach can be seen in this Google Colab notebook - [![Open In Colab][colab_badge]][colab_ex1_different_resolutions]
